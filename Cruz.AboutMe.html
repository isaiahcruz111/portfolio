		<ul><strong>About Me</strong>
			<ul id="paragraphaboutme">
				<img src="ME.PNG">
				<p>My name is Isaiah Cruz. In high school, I have taken a variety
				of courses concerning engineering, particularly software engineering
				Currently, I am
				taking the Digital Electronics class, in which I am gaining a large
				amount of experience in circuitry and electrical engineering practice. </p>
				<p>I am from Dublin, California and I have lived here ever since 
				I was born. I am Filipino and I love traveling with my family
				to make visits every 2 years to the Phillipines. Things I love to
				do at home are to play video games and the piano. I play 2 
				instruments, which are the piano and the sax. I played the
				alto and baritone sax in band for elementary and middle school.</p>
				<p>In the summer of 2018 I was able to attend the summer COSMOS program at 
				UC San Diego, and apply my knowledge gained in my classes of engineering
				in the Music and Technology Cluster.</p>
				<p>I have taken four classes of engineering throughout high school.
				Throughout CSE(Computer Science/Software Engineering) I have become familiar with
				multiple languages of code, such as HTML, JavaScript, Python, and 
				experience with Android App Creator. In my future, I hope to be 
				able to work for a company where I can program 
				and/or develop software. In POE (Principles of Engineering), I was able
				to gain experience in many different disciplines of engineering, and it
				was in this class that I was first exposed to robotics and physics. In my third 
				engineering course, AP Computer Science Applications, I was able to gain a huge
				amount of experience in Java, and learn more about the Agile Design
				Process, which is used in many areas of today's workforce. Finally, in 
				Digital Electronics, I am getting more exposure to circuitry and 
				electrical engineering discipline. Circuitry was never something I have
				been strong in, so this class has helped me improve in that area a lot. </p>
				<p>My goal in getting through college is to earn a Bachelor's or 
				Master's degree in the sciences, particularly physics or cognitive science. In 
				the future, careers in analytics, teaching, and applied mathematics are 
				of great appeal to me, as they reflect the person I have developed into in 
				four years of high school - a person who is 
				analytical, loving to help, and calculating. </p>
