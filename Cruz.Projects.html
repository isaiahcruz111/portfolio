		<p><u><strong>Project: Scratch Game</strong></u></p>
		<p>Dates: 9/15/15 - 10/3/15</p>
		<p>Program: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>

		<p>Course: Computer Science/Software Engineering 2015 - 2016</p>
		<p>I was assigned to program a game with my partner Mounica Padakandla. 
		We were required to use the online game creator Scratch to make any kind 
		of user-interactive game. This project was made and done towards the start 
		of freshman year, in October. Scratch helped us understand programming
		language/logic, and also let us have fun and be able to share our work.
		We let others comment on the game we made, which was an 
		RPG(role-playing game). The idea for the game was to combine RPG elements
		and quizzes. Our idea allowed us to combine both lists, transitions, and
		traveling distances of animations. This project taught us the importance
		of adding comments to our code, which would have helped us understand 
		our code more easily.</p>

		<p>The next project in freshman year was assigned to be developed with
		MIT App Inventor, and my partner was Mark Kong. MIT App Inventor is an
		app developer similar to Scratch, but this time we had learned from our 
		previous failures with comments. We were required to take open-source 
		code and modify it to make a better game. Our app had encountered 
		unknown packaging errors, which kept us from running the app that wasn't 
		hardlined. The app we made was a multiple choice quiz, which required us
		to use lists and indexes to call functions. The two central functions that
		we used were nextQuestion and GameOver, and their names explain themselves.
		Each of them required us to use many indexes and lists.</p>

		<p>This project was developed in Python 2.7, a language we used to develop 
		a text adventure. A text adventure is literally an adventure in text, where 
		the decisions you make from inputting input into different raw_input()s. In
		Canopy, we developed a code file to host our adventure. This project 
		tested our knowledge of loops and conditionals, and was an extension of 
		our printing abilities and logic. Our code looked like one huge function
		for running ease, with many other functions inside it to act in branching.
		The theme of our code was about Mr.Brown and a few of the other different
		teachers in the J Building at DHS. Overall, this project did not throw us 
		many difficulties, but was a very fun way to learn coding and get better
		in coding in Python. </p>

		<p>As the Computer Science/Software Engineering course came to a close, we were assigned 
		a project where we were assigned to creat a solution to any problem in society. 
		For our project, we decided to try and lower water usage on the farm. To 
		do this, we created a robot, titled IrriBot(irrigation bot). The concept 
		of the automated robot would include water- and energy- efficient 
		irrigation. Our proof-of-concept included sensors and the robot's 
		basic steel frame. The robot would be programmed to move forward, 
		with the sensors on a side "sensing" a plant, and the robot would lower
		a standoff that held a tube connected to a water source in place. Future 
		improvements would include even more sensors and other water openings,
		which would include solenoid valves for more water efficiency. In this 
		project, I developed the website for the robot's advertisement and was 
		a large part of the documentation.</p>

		<p>For this project, our test was to design a prototype of a vehicle
		that would either use hydrogen fuel cells or solar modules as its main
		and only power source. The project then required us to conduct measurements
		for power, time, and efficiency. To connect either the solar modules or 
		fuel cells to the car, a breadboard was used to provide power input to the
		car's motor. Voltage and current readings were conducted on the breadboard
		or the power source. After each calculation and measurement for power and
		efficiency, we were required to report a recommended power source for our
		client, Tesla Motors. In the end, our team proposed solar panels as the best
		power source, in comparison to hydrogen fuel cells. </p>
		<p>The power configuration in this picture was the two-solar-cell configuration.
		It turned out to also be the most efficient out of the four configurations.
		The ones that we tested were one solar panel, two solar panels, one hydrogen cell,
		and two hydrogen cells. The least efficient and least powerful configurations
		were the hydrogen cells, and the most efficient and powerful were the solar
		modules. </p>

		<p>The 2017 DEDA Entrepreneur Project routine followed was nearly the same as 
		the 2016 Entrepreneurship Project. The project, again, was open-ended and
		we were tasked with solving any problem in the world today. The problem we chose
		to solve was the overacidifaction of soil due to pollutants in rain and air. Prior 
		solutions that attempted to solve this problem was soil liming, where calcium carbonate
		solution is either manually dispersed by a person or mass-distributed by a vehicle. Both of 
		these have their own negative effects, as human labor may lose money for a company and take
		too much time, and machine-dispersed lime solution is cost-inefficient and imprecise. Our solution,
		pHbot, aimed to solve both of the problems of humans and tractors, and provide 
		farmers with a cost-efficient opportunity to optimalize the crop yield on their farms. In this
		project, I worked with Ashley Chon and Ethan Tai, who are two other students (as of May 2017)
		that are also taking Principles of Engineering. The contributions that I made to the project 
		were the development of the project website, robot construction, and research conduction.

		<p><u><strong>Project 2.1.6: Nutrition Counselor </strong></u></p>
		<p>Dates: November 28, 2018 - December 6, 2018</p>
		<p>Programs: Multisim 14.1</p>
		<p>Course: Digital Electronics 2018-2019</p>

		In Digital Electronics, we were tasked with creating a circuit implementing
		our newfound experience of the circuit design process, boolean algebra, and logic
		expression simplification. To finish this task, a team member and I 
		decided to work together and create our own circuit. The circuit required
		a total of six inputs (buttons or switches) to create an end result
		since we were a team of two.
		</p>
		<p>
		Therefore, we decided to design and test a prototype nutritional
		counselor that uses different aspects of AOI Logic. Based on the 
		food groups a customer says he/she is eating, they can use this
		system to see if they have eaten healthily. One person will be able
		to input the different food groups they have eaten in a day into our
		nutritional counselor, and if a minimum of three of the healthy food
		groups have been consumed (healthy fats, meats, dairy,
		fruits/vegetables, and grains/carbohydrates), they have eaten
		healthy. However, if sugar-/fat- high foods have been eaten with
		healthy fats, we cannot say that they have eaten healthy
		since they may easily exceed their body's fat consumption limit.
		</p>
		<p>
		As the project manager, my responsibilities were to manage the time spent
		on each subtask in our project, whether it was documentation updating or
		making sure that our project was being completed in a timely manner. Since we
		were a team of two, it was not always easy to physically work on the breadboard of the
		project together since both of us could not physically touch it at the same time,
		handle it at the same time, or bring it home at the same time. Therefore, 
		I was limited to working on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1462-3751RelpGBv7yp28PbaSSsbJwL3l?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> documentation </a> 
		updates, truth table management, and
		simplification of our logic expression. However, both of us were able to 
		work together on torubleshooting our project and create the original project idea.
